Description:
This directory contains a copy of the lit-element framework and some elements
from the Material Web Components catalog.

At time of writing, this is a copy of third_party/material_web_components from
the chromium/src repo, with only the bare minimum required to recreate the
'components-chromium' directory, and a Go module that embeds this directory.

Local Modifications:
- Replaced CRLF line endings with LF line endings in text files.
- Removed files that are not needed by Chromium, see rsync_exclude.txt.

To restore the contents of the 'components-chromium' directory from scratch, run
./reproduce.sh on a Linux machine.
